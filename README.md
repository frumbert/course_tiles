# course_tiles
Moodle block for displaying courses in tiles

The layout uses a template which displays courses as tiles in a grid. It also writes the users completion or enrolment status onto a data attribute for each tile which you can pick up in styles, as shown below.

This is a block plugin and belongs in the blocks folder. It works best in a theme that allows a center column. In my example I've used boost_campus on Moodle 3.6.4 with a custom area in the centre column. YMMV.
